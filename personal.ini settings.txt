[defaults]
## [defaults] section applies to all formats and sites but may be
## overridden at several levels.  Example:

## [defaults]
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status
## [www.whofic.com]
## # overrides defaults.
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,dateUpdated,rating
## [epub]
## # overrides defaults & site section
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,datePublished,dateUpdated,dateCreated
## [www.whofic.com:epub]
## # overrides defaults, site section & format section
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,datePublished
## [overrides]
## # overrides all other sections
## titlepage_entries: category

## Some sites also require the user to confirm they are adult for
## adult content.  Uncomment by removing '#' in front of is_adult.
#is_adult:true

## Don't like the numbers at the start of chapter titles on some
## sites?  You can use strip_chapter_numbers to strip them off.  Just
## want to make them all look the same?  Strip them off, then add them
## back on with add_chapter_numbers.  Don't like the way it strips
## numbers or adds them back?  See chapter_title_strip_pattern and
## chapter_title_add_pattern.
#strip_chapter_numbers:true
#add_chapter_numbers:true

## Add this to genre if there's more than one category.
#add_genre_when_multi_category: Crossover

[epub]
## include images from img tags in the body and summary of stories.
## Images will be converted to jpg for size if possible.  Images work
## in epub format only.  To get mobi or other format with images,
## download as epub and use Calibre to convert.
#include_images:true

## Quality level to use when converting images to jpg. Range is 0-100,
## reasonable values likely to be in the range 70-95.
#jpg_quality: 95

## If not set, the summary will have all html stripped for safety.
## Both this and include_images must be true to get images in the
## summary.
#keep_summary_html:true

## If set, the first image found will be made the cover image.  If
## keep_summary_html is true, any images in summary will be before any
## in chapters.
#make_firstimage_cover:true

## Resize images down to width, height, preserving aspect ratio.
## Nook size, with margin.
#image_max_size: 580, 725

## Change image to grayscale, if graphics library allows, to save
## space.
#grayscale_images: false


## Most common, I expect will be using this to save username/passwords
## for different sites.  Here are a few examples.  See defaults.ini
## for the full list.

#username:YourPenname
#password:YourPassword
## default is false
#collect_series: true

## Some sites do not require a login, but do require the user to
## confirm they are adult for adult content.
#is_adult:true

## tth is a little unusual--it doesn't require user/pass, but the site
## keeps track of which chapters you've read and won't send another
## update until it thinks you're up to date.  This way, on download,
## it thinks you're up to date.
