## Easy Fanfic Library: Using Calibre & FanFicFare

The Easy Fanfic Library project enables users to easily download works from AO3 and other fanfiction sites into a library in Calibre, a free e-book management application, with all the metadata (title, author, series, ratings, warnings, characters, relationships, additional tags, date posted, etc.) intact and in separate fields. This way you will be able to quickly download fanfiction and sort/filter downloaded works similarly to how you would filter on AO3 itself (including by your personal bookmark data and tags). This will work with fanfiction sites besides AO3, but the project was designed for AO3 works, and is optimized for the organization of AO3 works.

The objective of this project is an easy setup process for a fanfiction library on your computer. To set up a working fanfiction library, only four steps are required. If you wish to include your bookmark information in the metadata for AO3 works, just two more steps are needed. Any additional steps are optional and mainly involve personalizing how the library is displayed.

Calibre is a comprehensive free and open source e-book library management application which lets you organize your e-books by different metadata (such as title, author, series, and tags) within an e-book library. It comes with its own e-book viewer that can view most major e-book formats (such as EPUB), but you can also open files in another viewer if desired. It can connect to most e-book reading devices, tablets, and smartphones, so you can transfer your e-books to your mobile devices or set up the ability to view your libraries from a mobile browser. For more information on Calibre, see <https://calibre-ebook.com/>.

The Easy Fanfic Library is a sample Calibre library that users can download and import into the Calibre application on their own computer.

* The sample library has the Calibre plugin FanFicFare pre-installed. FanFicFare (<https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/CalibrePlugin>) is what enables you to download fanfiction and metadata directly into Calibre (from URLs). The sample library pre-configures FanFicFare to send fanfiction metadata to the appropriate columns/fields.
* The sample library has the Calibre plugin EpubMerge pre-installed. EpubMerge (<https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=169744>) interfaces with the FanFicFare plugin and adds the option of downloading a group or series of works as a single EPUB anthology.
